            <p class="first-detail">I am studying B.Sc. in CSE at Daffodil International University. I always try to
                learn
                new
                technology. I like to build PC though I have built it twice only. When I have time, I watch anime, TV
                series, or
                movies. I also enjoy listening to music. My goal is to be a computer programmer in the future.<br><br>
